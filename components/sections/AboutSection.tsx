            I am a passionate and versatile Software Engineering student with
            over {calculateDuration('2023-01-01', false)} of JavaScript
            experience and a keen interest in learning new technologies. I am
            currently exploring machine learning and mastering tools and
            practices such as TypeScript, AWS, Docker, and SEO to deliver
            optimized, reliable, and production-grade software.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base text-gray-400">
            I have solid experience in web frontend development, utilizing
            frameworks and technologies such as React and Next.js. My backend
            development skills include working with Node, Express, MongoDB, and
            Python. Additionally, I have UX design experience using Figma and
            Photoshop. I adhere to best practices in prototyping and coding,
            clean architecture, SOLID principles, and agile methodologies.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base text-gray-400">
            Beyond my internship and course work, I engage in personal projects
            where I create useful software or products from design and
            development to deployment on Vercel/Heroku/AWS. These projects aim
            to solve problems, provide inspiration, or enhance user experiences
            by delivering software tailored to providing specific solutions.

            programming languages and technology stacks, both Backend and
            Frontend, though I enjoy Frontend Development more!

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am interested in learning Backend with other language like Java, Go or with Python. I also want to know how to make a video game with Unity or other and I am very interested in being a content creator whether programming or something else.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            For now I'm learning how to make applications with real time communication such as a chat using Socket.IO, I'm also starting to learn the way to be Devops using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS or others.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am also interested in learning other things besides programming such as 3D design with Blender and video editing with Davinci Resolve (these last two I would take as a hobby).
