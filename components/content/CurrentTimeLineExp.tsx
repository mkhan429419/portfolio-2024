        <TimelineEvent.Description>
          Worked with a supervisor to develop DataHub, a file management system
          that utilizes modern tech stacks and securely stores the users data
          using AWS. <br />
          - Utilized MERN stack for development, including React, Typescript,
          and TailwindCSS for the frontend, Node and Express for backend, and
          MongoDB for the database. Files were handled securely using AWS S3,
          and JWT was used for token-based authentication. <br />- Learned
          modern deployment methods: frontend was deployed on vercel, backend on
          heroku, and database on MongoDB Atlas.

          utilizing CSS grid layout. Event listeners, statements, operators, and
          loops were used to handle user input and perform calculations.
